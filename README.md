# âš¡ Sentiment Shock â€” LSTM + Transformer + Visuals

Welcome to **Sentiment Shock**, a fun and interactive demo app for sentiment analysis! This project combines the power of **pretrained Transformers** and a **lightweight BiLSTM** to analyze text sentiment, visualize insights, and make the results visually engaging. Perfect for demos, learning, or just showing off NLP magic! ðŸ˜Ž

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

The goal of this project is to provide a **hands-on, visual, and interactive way** to explore sentiment analysis:

- **Live demo:** Type or paste any text and instantly see the predicted sentiment.
- **Batch demo:** Upload CSV files of reviews and get predictions with confidence scores.
- **Visualizations:** Word clouds, attention heatmaps, UMAP embeddings, and confusion matrices.
- **Explainability:** Optional token-level interpretability via attention or integrated gradients.
- **Training:** Train a small BiLSTM locally for demo purposes to understand sequence learning.

This project is **educational**, visually engaging, and demonstrates the **strength of Transformers vs. LSTMs** on text sentiment tasks.

## ðŸ›  Features

1. **Live Text Sentiment Prediction**  
   Type any review or sentence and see the predicted sentiment immediately.

2. **Batch Prediction**  
   Upload CSV files with a `text` column and get predictions for multiple entries. Download results as a CSV.

3. **Visualizations & Explainability**  
   - Attention heatmaps for Transformers  
   - Word clouds for input text  
   - UMAP projection of embeddings  
   - Confusion matrices for evaluation

4. **Optional BiLSTM Training**  
   Train a small BiLSTM on a local CSV for demo purposes. Not production-grade but great for learning.
